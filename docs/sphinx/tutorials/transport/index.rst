Tutorials: Chemical Transport
=============================

Chemical equilibrium and kinetics calculations are both *space independent*. If
you need to model transport processes (e.g., advection, diffusion) combined
with chemical reactive processes, then *chemical transport* (or reactive
transport) simulations are what you need.
